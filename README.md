# Scouting for Japanese Cherry Trees in Vancouver

This is the shinyr showcase in submission to Ming Cao's STAT545B Assignment 3. I chose **Option B** and created my own Shiny app.

## App Description

You can access the application on shinyapps.io: [cherryhunting.shinyapps.io/tree_app/](https://cherryhunting.shinyapps.io/tree_app/).

The goal of this project is to explore the distribution and tree diameter of Japanese cherry trees in Vancouver, Canada.

## App Design 

The app includes 4 features:
- an interactive leaflet map
- a cherry flower image
- a dynamic histogram
- a dynamic data table
